    <h1>Powers</h1>
    <p>The powers in Jujutsu Kaisen rely on a concept called Cursed Energy, which comes from
        <br>
        the users negative emotions. The user could use this energy to create techniques, which
        <br>
        are called Cursed Techniques. High leveled sorcerers can turn their cursed energy negative
        <br>
        which allows them to heal themselves, and others.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The main character Yuji Itadori inherits the power of Sukuna, and his brother Choso which allows
        <br>
            him to use blood manipulation, and shrine technique.
